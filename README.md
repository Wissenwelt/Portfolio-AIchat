‚ú® Welcome to My Digital Space!
Hello and welcome! This is the official repository for my personal portfolio website. I built this project not just to showcase my skills and experience, but to create a modern, interactive, and engaging web experience from the ground up.

This project is a testament to my passion for clean code, beautiful design, and cutting-edge technology. I invite you to explore the live demo or dive into the code yourself.

üîß Getting Started: Clone & Run Locally
Interested in running this project on your own machine? Follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18.x or later)

npm, yarn, or pnpm

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Wissenwelt/Portfolio-AIchat.git

2. Install Dependencies
Install all the necessary packages using your preferred package manager:

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install

3. Set Up Environment Variables
This project requires a couple of API keys to function correctly. Create a new file named .env.local in the root of your project.

touch .env.local

Now, open .env.local and add the following variables. Never share your API keys or commit this file to your repository!

# Get your key from https://web3forms.com/
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_KEY=YOUR_WEB3FORMS_API_KEY_HERE

# Get your API key from the Cerebras Cloud platform
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=YOUR_CEREBRAS_API_KEY_HERE

4. Install Cerebras SDK (If needed)
The backend API route relies on the Cerebras SDK. While it should be included in the package.json dependencies, ensure it's installed correctly.

npm install @cerebras/cerebras_cloud_sdk

5. Run the Development Server
You're all set! Start the development server:

npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the website in action.
