‚ú® Welcome to My Digital Space
Hello and welcome to my portfolio repository! I've crafted this project not just to showcase my skills and experience, but to create a modern, interactive, and engaging web experience from the ground up.

Meet Archie - Your AI Guide: The standout feature of this portfolio is the integrated AI Assistant powered by Llama 3.1 8B. Feel free to ask it anything about my work, skills, or even just to say hello!

This project is a testament to my passion for clean code, beautiful design, and cutting-edge technology. I invite you to explore the live demo or dive into the code yourself.
